This is a classic case of **"Stage Yellow Philosophy"** (Theory) vs. **"Stage Yellow Engineering"** (Practice).

Currently, the content is **beautiful, profound, and structurally elegant**. It perfectly mirrors *Nondualize* and *Spiralize*.

**However**, if your goal is to support **Stuga** (Väsby) and the **Baltic Initiative**, this current content is **too abstract**.

* A neighbor in Upplands Väsby who wants to borrow a drill via Stuga does not want to read about "Inner Commons" or "Nondualize." They want a checklist on how to trust a stranger.
* Ea and Jaanup in Estonia are practical homesteaders. They need "Governance Protocols," not "Shadow Work" essays.

Here is my **Keep/Revise/Delete** assessment to pivot the site from a "Library of Philosophy" to a "Manual for Resilience."

---

### 1. Home Page / Hero Section

**Status: REVISE HEAVILY**

* **Current:** "From Isolation to Communion... Exploring the process of communizing..."
* **The Problem:** It sounds like a spiritual retreat.
* **The Pivot:** Make it the **"User Manual for Society."**
* **New Direction:**
> **Headline:** "The Operating System for Trust."
> **Sub:** "Practical protocols for building resilient neighborhoods, sharing resources, and governing the commons. The social software that makes the hardware work."



### 2. The Four Scales

**Status: KEEP STRUCTURE, REVISE CONTENT**

The *fractal structure* is brilliant (Inner -> Planetary). Keep that. But change the *content* to be actionable "Recipes."

* **Inner Commons:** **DELETE or HIDE.**
* *Why:* "Communizing the psyche" is too esoteric for a resilience site. It scares off the municipal "Svensson." Move this content to *Nondualize.org* or a deep archive.


* **Relational Commons:** **REVISE.**
* *New Focus:* "Micro-Agreements." How to lend a lawnmower without it getting awkward. How to set boundaries with neighbors.


* **Societal Commons:** **KEEP & EXPAND.**
* *New Focus:* This is the **Stuga** layer. Tool libraries, FRG groups, Food Co-ops. This should be the biggest section.


* **Planetary Commons:** **REVISE.**
* *New Focus:* "Bioregionalism." Connect this explicitly to the **Baltic Initiative**. It's not just "Global Governance"; it's "Watershed Management."



### 3. The Ecosystem (Nondualize/Spiralize Links)

**Status: MOVE TO FOOTER**

* **Why:** Putting "Nondualize" (Awakening) front and center makes *Communize* look like a spiritual project. You want it to look like a **Civil Defense / Infrastructure** project. Keep the links for those who dig deep, but don't lead with them.

### 4. The Toolkit (Agreement Templates, Resource Mapper)

**Status: PROMOTE TO HERO**

* **Verdict:** **This is the gold mine.** This is what makes the site useful for Väsby and Estonia.
* **Action:** Move this *up*. These shouldn't be buried.
* **Resource Mapper:** Rename to "Asset Mapping Guide" (The manual for Stuga's map).
* **Agreement Templates:** These are crucial for the Baltic homesteaders (e.g., "Land Stewardship Agreements").



### 5. Models & Praxis (Case Studies)

**Status: REVISE (Add Your Own)**

* **Current:** Wikipedia, Rojava, Totnes. (Standard examples).
* **Action:** Keep these for credibility, but **add placeholders for your pilots.**
* *Coming Soon:* "Digital Civil Defense in Upplands Väsby."
* *Coming Soon:* "Bioregional Coordination in the Baltic Sea."
* *Why:* This signals that the site is *active*, not just a history book.



### 6. The Knowledge Commons (Books/Theory)

**Status: KEEP**

* **Verdict:** Good for SEO and authority. Keep Ostrom and Graeber. It shows you have done the homework.

### Summary of the Pivot

You are moving the site from **"Education"** to **"Facilitation."**

| Section | Old Vibe (Philosopher) | New Vibe (Architect) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hero** | "Weaving the social fabric" | "Protocols for Resilience" |
| **Inner Scale** | "Shadow Work & IFS" | *(Deleted/Moved)* |
| **Relational** | "Shared Fields of Belonging" | "Agreements & Trust Mechanics" |
| **Societal** | "Mutual Aid Structures" | "The Stuga Manual (Tools/Energy)" |
| **Toolkit** | A secondary section | **The Main Product** |

**Recommendation:**
Keep the site live. It is a fantastic asset.
But for the next update, strip out the "spiritual" language and replace it with "systems" language. This makes it safe for Laura, Ea, Jaanup, and the Väsby municipality to share without feeling like they are joining a cult.
